# queue_array_c
## Overview

This project implements a queue using a fixed-size array in C. It features a menu-driven interface that allows users to perform basic queue operations, including enqueue (adding an element), dequeue (removing an element), and displaying the queue contents.

## Features

- **Enqueue**: Add a new element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Display**: Print all elements in the queue from front to rear.
- **Exit**: Terminate the program.

## Files

- `queue.c`: Contains the implementation of the queue with a menu-driven interface.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use a C compiler such as `gcc`. Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
gcc -o queue queue.c
